## Description
As captain, I led my high school robotics team through our rookie year at RoboSub, an international collegiate competition for autonomous underwater vehicles.

## Outcome
As a rookie team competing against top universities, we set a modest goal - to qualify in the first round of the competition.  We achieved that goal on day one! Over the next five days, despite component failures and code bugs, we continuously improved our robot's autonomous performance to place 13th out of 41 teams. We advanced through semi-finals to the third-chance playoffs, outperforming established programs from Stanford, Harvey Mudd, and UCLA, ultimately earning the Rookie of the Year award.

## The leadup
Leading the development of our competition robot required managing an extremely compressed timeline. We faced severe time constraints - receiving our kit in March, batteries in May, and achieving the first water test in June after school ended. As team captain, I coordinated pool testing sessions and led troubleshooting activities throughout the summer.

RoboSub requires that all robots have a kill switch for autonomous operation. After discovering an error in the manufacturer's documentation that damaged our first kill switch, I worked through methodical troubleshooting and collaborated directly with the manufacturerâ€™s engineering team to identify and fix their documentation mistake. The company verified my findings and immediately sent us replacement parts. 

Our biggest challenge came the week before competition: unreliable motor control due to errors in our robot kit's Python library documentation. I led daily coding and testing sessions, finally achieving reliable control just two days before departure. We completed most of our autonomous control code on the flight to California and at the competition site, ultimately delivering a fully functional vehicle that exceeded all of our initial goals.

## The competition
We completed final coding for qualification the day before competition, then qualified on our first attempt - an incredible moment. The following days were a blur of early mornings, code modifications, bug fixes, late nights, and testing sessions.

After advancing to semi-finals, our run missed finals qualification but earned us a spot in the third-chance playoffs. Though our successful playoff run wasn't enough to reach finals, we had exceeded all of our expectations and outperformed all other rookie teams.

The competition was an incredible experience I will never forget. The supportive competition environment allowed us to network with other schools and industry professionals, including the lead developer of our control library, with whom we shared our documentation improvements (politely). Winning Rookie of the Year was the perfect conclusion, and we're already preparing for RoboSub 2025.
