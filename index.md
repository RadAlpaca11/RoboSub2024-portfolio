# RoboSub 2024

## Description
Leading my high school robotics team to a successful rookie year at an international autonomous underwater vehicle robotics competition.

## Outcome
Our team placed 13th overall, making it past the semi-finals to the third chance playoffs, ahead of universities including Stanford, Harvey Mudd, UCLA, and more.
We also won Rookie of the Year.

## The leadup
We began meeting in January, a robot kit was purchased in March, we didn't get batteries until May, and the robot didn't even touch water until June, after school was out for summer.

There was a lot of work to be done over the summer. We didn't know how to control the robot, and even if we did, it wasn't competition legal yet.
Over the summer I had to coordinate testing sessions at local pools, and making sure things were moving forward with the robot.

One of the things we needed to do to make the robot competition legal was the addition of a kill switch. 
There were specific guidelines on how the switch had to work, and after a lot of research we purchased a kit that would work.
When installing the switch I noticed that the instructions seemed off, it looked like the wires were reversed.
I was installing it with another team member and we decided to just trust the instructions. 
It didn't work, so I had to do a ton of troubleshooting, and called tech support for the company we purchased the kit from. 
I was able to talk to an engineer and explain to him that I believed there was an error in their instructions.
They were supper appreciative of me pointing out the mistake and sent us replacement parts.

The week leading up to the competition, we still had no idea how to control the motors on the robot.
The python library documentation for the robot kit we were using was confusing, and actually wrong in some places.
This week involved hours of coding and out of water testing each day just to activate a single motor reliably. 
We figured it out 2 days before we left for the competition.
Almost all of our code was written on the plane to California, or at the competition.

## The competition
We were able to get some pool testing in at a team member's relative's house the day before the competition started, where we wrote the code we believed would get us qualified.
The first day of the competition we qualified on our first try!
It was surreal and one of the best feeling's I've ever felt.
