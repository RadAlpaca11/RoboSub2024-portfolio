## Description
Leading my high school robotics team to a successful rookie year at an international autonomous underwater vehicle robotics competition.

## Outcome
Our goal was to qualify at the competition.
Our team placed 13th overall out of 41 teams from around the world, making it past the semi-finals to the third chance playoffs, ahead of universities including Stanford, Harvey Mudd, UCLA, and more.
We also won Rookie of the Year.

## The leadup
We began meeting in January, a robot kit was purchased in March, we didn't get batteries until May, and the robot didn't even touch water until June, after school was out for summer.

There was a lot of work to be done over the summer. We didn't know how to control the robot, and even if we did, it wasn't competition legal yet.
Over the summer I had to coordinate testing sessions at local pools, and making sure things were moving forward with the robot.

One of the things we needed to do to make the robot competition legal was the addition of a kill switch. 
There were specific guidelines on how the switch had to work, and after a lot of research we purchased a kit that would work.
When installing the switch I noticed that the instructions seemed off, it looked like the wires were reversed.
I was installing it with another team member and we decided to just trust the instructions. 
It didn't work, so I had to do a ton of troubleshooting, and called tech support for the company we purchased the kit from. 
I was able to talk to an engineer and explain to him that I believed there was an error in their instructions.
They were supper appreciative of me pointing out the mistake and sent us replacement parts.

The week leading up to the competition, we still had no idea how to control the motors on the robot.
The python library documentation for the robot kit we were using was confusing, and actually wrong in some places.
This week involved hours of coding and out of water testing each day just to activate a single motor reliably. 
We figured it out 2 days before we left for the competition.
Almost all of our code was written on the plane to California, or at the competition.

## The competition
We were able to get some pool testing in at a team member's relative's house the day before the competition started, where we wrote the code we believed would get us qualified.
The first day of the competition we qualified on our first try!
It was surreal and one of the best feeling's I've ever felt.

The next few days were filled with early mornings, testing the robot, modifying code, fixing bugs, lots of ice cream, and late nights.
We went the direction of building our own code library to make the main code easier to edit, which meant when we made changes it could really screw things up (it didn't help that we were extremely sleep deprived).

We were able to score high enough in our semi-final runs to move on to the third chance playoffs, which would give us a chance at a wildcard slot in the finals.
Sadly we didn't make it past that, but we made it way further than we ever hoped.

The competition experience was something I will never forget.
The environment was so fun, and we were able to talk to professionals, even showing our code to the author of the library we were using, and pointing out the mistakes in their documentation.

Hearing our team's name said when announcing places or awards was incredible, and I can't wait to do it again in 2025.
