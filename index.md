## Description
As captain, leading my high school robotics team through a successful rookie year competing at an international collegiate autonomous underwater vehicle robotics competition.

## Outcome
Since this was our first year and we were competing against some of the top universities around the world, our team goal was simply to qualify at the competition.  We accomplished that on the first day.


During the remaining 5 days of the competition, we continued to improve our robot’s autonomous performance (including dealing with a few component failures), eventually placing 13th overall out of 41 teams.  We made it past the semi-finals to the third chance playoff round and ultimately beat some big name schools including Stanford, Harvey Mudd, UCLA, and more.  


And to round out an amazing experience and team performance, we won Rookie of the Year!

## The leadup
Leading the development of our competition robot required managing an extremely compressed timeline. After receiving our robot kit in March, batteries in May, and achieving our first water test in June after school ended, we faced significant technical challenges throughout the summer. As team captain, I led all the troubleshooting activities, tackled some critical technical hurdles, and coordinated regular testing sessions at local pools.

Since the robot would operate autonomously, we had to install a kill switch to be competition-legal. After researching and selecting appropriate components, I discovered an error in the manufacturer's installation documentation. Working alongside a teammate, we initially followed the instructions but the kill switch didn’t work. Through methodical troubleshooting and direct collaboration with the manufacturer's engineering team, I identified their documentation showed the wiring backwards. The company confirmed the error and provided replacement parts.

The week before competition presented our biggest technical obstacle: we still couldn't reliably control the robot's motors. The Python library documentation for our robot kit contained errors and unclear instructions. I led daily coding and testing sessions to solve this fundamental challenge. We achieved reliable motor control just two days before competition, completing the majority of our autonomous control code during our flight to California and at the competition site. Despite these time constraints and technical setbacks, we delivered a fully functional autonomous underwater vehicle that exceeded our initial competition goals.


## The competition
We did some pool testing the day before the competition started, where we wrote the code we believed would get us qualified. Then, on the first day of the competition, we qualified on our first try! It was surreal and one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt. 

The next several days were filled with early mornings, testing the robot, modifying code, fixing bugs, late nights, little sleep, and lots of ice cream to keep us going.

Having qualified, we advanced to the semi-finals. Our semi-final run, unfortunately, didn’t score enough to secure a spot in the finals, but we did score enough points to get a spot in the third chance playoffs to compete for a wildcard spot in the finals. The following day, that run, while successful, did not earn us enough points to get to the finals.  Alas, our RoboSub 2024 run had come to an end, but an end MUCH further than we had ever hoped. 

The competition was an incredible experience I will never forget. The environment was so fun, all the other schools were so supportive of us, and we were even able to talk to industry professionals including the lead developer of the the library we were using. We got a chance to show him our work and to (politely) point out where their documentation was incorrect. 

And finally, hearing our team’s name announced as the Rookie of the Year was the cherry on top. We are already working towards RoboSub 2025 and I can’t wait.
