# RoboSub 2024

## Description
Leading my high school robotics team to a successful rookie year at an international autonomous underwater vehicle robotics competition.

## Outcome
Our team placed 13th overall, making it past the semi-finals to the third chance playoffs, ahead of universities including Stanford, Harvey Mudd, UCLA, and more.
We also won Rookie of the Year.

## The leadup
We began meeting in January, a robot kit was purchased in March, we didn't get batteries until May, and the robot didn't even touch water until June, after school was out for summer.

There was a lot of work to be done over the summer. We didn't know how to control the robot, and even if we did, it wasn't competition legal yet.
Over the summer I had to coordinate testing sessions at local pools, and making sure things were moving forward with the robot.

One of the things we needed to do to make the robot competition legal was the addition of a kill switch. 
There were specific guidelines on how the switch had to work, and after a lot of research we purchased a kit that would work.
When installing the switch I noticed that the instructions seemed off, it looked like the wires were reversed.
I was installing it with another team member and we decided to just trust the instructions. 
It didn't work, so I had to do a ton of troubleshooting, and called tech support for the company we purchased the kit from. 
I was able to talk to an engineer and explain to him that I believed there was an error in their instructions.
They were supper appreciative of me pointing out the mistake and sent us replacement parts.
